# React State Practice

The goal of this application was to practice with React state and conditional rendering.

Goals:

1. Make an array of at least 3 objects using the above shape and render the item, quantity and units (12 pack, 1lb, 2 liters, etc)
2. Make inputs so that new items can be added
3. Conditionally render the grocery items based on whether or not they were purchased (ok to have hard coded values for isPurchased)

CSS wasn't the focus of this assignment, so not much attention was directed towards it.
